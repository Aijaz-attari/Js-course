         6. console.error

class 3: 1. Use `` when describe html in js
         2. const cant be redeclared but const of array can be declared by using push
         3. there are various cases to describe variables in javascript. camelCase kebab-case snake_case PascalCase

class 4. 1. Seven data types that are primitives: string, number, boolean, null, undefined, and symbol
         2. refer mdn docs

class 5. 1. to convet data type to string while declaration, just type String(value)
         2. use toString(value) to convert 
         3. we can parse the value of number by parse float and int
         4. to describe the number of digits after decimals, add tofixed
         5. we can see charat, concat, indexof, lastindexof, endswith, inculdes, sunstirng(x, y), slice and replace{first occurence}
         5. split will split the string where the given value is written in arrays
         6. temlate literals means html in js using `` and printing exact what needed with html sense
         7. prefer uning ${} for variable in string
         8. We can insert html in js by writing document.body.innerhtml = {variable with html}

class 6. 1. Array.isArray() tells that it is array or not
         2. we can assign elements in array by arr[3] = {element}
         3. push will add the elemnt in array at last
         4. unshift will add element at start
         5. pop will remove the last element
         6. shift will remove first element
         7. splice will remove the elements from (from, no. of elements)
         8. reverse will reverse the array
         9. all methods will change the original array
         10. concat will cantact element
         
class 7. 1. == will check exact value, whereas === will also check type
         2. elseif is there
         3. ! means not
         4. !== is used when you want to check that there is any variable which is defined or not, so write {variable} !== 'undefined
         5. && means and 
         6. || means or
         7. tereneray operator format {varaible} == {value}? {if condition} : {else condition}
         8. switch case break default function

class 8. 1. i++ will increase 1
         2. do while loop will do the code one time only and then implement the condition of while
         3. break means stop the loop and continue the further code
         4. continue will skip the current iteration and continue the further iterations
         5. To iterate the array use, foreach(function({element/index/array}){console.log{varaible}})
         6. in for in loop, key means value and {variable}[key] means property  

class 10. 1. in func, function {name}(variable 1, ...2, ...3){code} {name}(first value, second value)
          2. we can add default value to variables of func
          3. return in func will return anything
          4. console of call of func will by undefined

class 11. 1. innerheight and width will tell h and w
          2. scrollX AND Y tell value
          3. location have reload, href, we can set href to another website also, toString gives url of current page

          6. alert, promp, confirm, links
          7. we can access all by documnet.all un form of array by Array.from(a).fromeach(function(c) console.log(c))

class 13. 1. let a = document.links; Array.from(a).forEach(function (element) {let b = element.href;let bn = b.includes('google');if (bn) {console.log(b)}})

class 14. 1. we can target elements by getElementById, className(nogebi), childNodes, parentNode
          2. we can apply css by .style.property = value
          3. we can change selected element text by .innertext =""
          4. we can change selected element code using html tags by .innerHTML =""
          5. query selector means document.querySelector('#/./ tag')
          6. these all will apply only to single element
          7. gebiClassName will select all classes
          8. gesbiTagName will select all tag
